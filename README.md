# Hi, I'm Rachith! 👋
### CS & Data Science Student @ University of Wisconsin-Madison

I am a software engineer specializing in **Cloud Security**, **Distributed Systems**, and **Automation**. I previously interned at **Yahoo (Paranoid AI)**, where I engineered high-performance tools for Code-to-Cloud Security Posture Management.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **High-Performance HTTP Load Balancers in C++**
- [cite_start]🎓 Studying at **University of Wisconsin-Madison** (Class of 2027) [cite: 7, 8, 9]
- 💬 Ask me about **Cloud Security, Java Optimization, and FRC**

### 💼 Work Experience

[cite_start]**Software Engineering Intern @ Yahoo (Paranoid AI Team)** [cite: 11]
*Engineered a Code-to-Cloud Security Posture platform to trace vulnerabilities across the application lifecycle.*
- [cite_start]🛡️ **Security Infrastructure:** Built an end-to-end platform tracing issues across the **code-container-cloud** lifecycle, increasing deployment reliability[cite: 14].
- [cite_start]🚀 **Performance Optimization:** Achieved a **90% reduction** in security scan latency (90m → 5m) by refactoring compiler data shuffling, effectively unblocking CI/CD pipelines[cite: 15].
- [cite_start]☁️ **Observability:** Improved repository-to-cloud integration observability by **20%** and cut root-cause analysis time from **2 hours to 5 minutes** via a unified AI-driven dashboard[cite: 16, 17].
