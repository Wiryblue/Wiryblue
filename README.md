## Work Experience

**Software Engineering Intern @ Yahoo (Paranoid AI Team)**
*Engineered a Code-to-Cloud Security Posture platform to trace vulnerabilities across the application lifecycle.*

* **Security Infrastructure:** Built an end-to-end platform tracing issues across the code-container-cloud lifecycle, increasing deployment reliability.
* **Performance Optimization:** Achieved a **90% reduction** in security scan latency (90m → 5m) by refactoring compiler data shuffling, effectively unblocking CI/CD pipelines.
* **Observability:** Improved repository-to-cloud integration observability by **20%** and cut root-cause analysis time from **2 hours to 5 minutes** via a unified AI-driven dashboard.
